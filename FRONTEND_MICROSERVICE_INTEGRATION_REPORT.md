# Frontend Microservice Integration Report

## Overview
This report documents the migration status of the frontend application to microservice architecture.

## API File Migration Status

### Completed API File Migrations
- 鉁?auth.ts - Authentication service integration
- 鉁?base.ts - Base service integration  
- 鉁?cattle.ts - Cattle service integration
- 鉁?health.ts - Health service integration
- 鉁?feeding.ts - Feeding service integration
- 鉁?material.ts - Material service integration
- 鉁?equipment.ts - Equipment service integration
- 鉁?sales.ts - Sales service integration
- 鉁?purchase.ts - Procurement service integration
- 鉁?news.ts - News service integration
- 鉁?user.ts - User management (auth service)
- 鉁?upload.ts - File service integration
- 鉁?dashboard.ts - Monitoring service integration
- 鉁?patrol.ts - Patrol service (monitoring service)
- 鉁?barn.ts - Barn management (base service)
- 鉁?help.ts - Help system (notification + news service)
- 鉁?portal.ts - Portal management (notification service)

### Microservice Route Configuration
All microservices are configured with unified route prefix /api/v1/ to ensure consistency with backend microservice routes.

### API Client Configuration
- Uses unified UnifiedApiClient for HTTP requests
- Configured with retry mechanism and error handling
- Supports request/response interceptors
- Unified error handling and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Testing & Validation**: Start all microservices and test frontend API calls
2. **Error Handling**: Improve degradation handling when microservices are unavailable
3. **Performance Optimization**: Implement API request caching and batch requests
4. **Monitoring Integration**: Add frontend API call monitoring and metrics collection

## Notes

1. All API calls have been switched to microservice architecture
2. Maintained original API interface signatures to ensure frontend components need no modification
3. Added comprehensive error handling and retry mechanisms
4. Supports microservice health checks and failover
