# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The cattle management system project has extensive build errors preventing successful compilation. The backend has 194 TypeScript errors across 32 files, and the frontend has 466 TypeScript errors across 40 files. These errors need to be systematically fixed to restore the project to a buildable state.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the backend to compile successfully without TypeScript errors, so that I can build and deploy the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend build command is executed THEN the system SHALL compile without any TypeScript errors
2. WHEN TypeScript strict mode is enabled THEN all type annotations SHALL be properly defined
3. WHEN controller methods are defined THEN they SHALL have proper return statements and type annotations
4. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL use proper Sequelize type definitions
5. WHEN authentication middleware is used THEN user properties SHALL be properly typed

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the frontend to compile successfully without TypeScript errors, so that I can build and serve the web application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend build command is executed THEN the system SHALL compile without any TypeScript errors
2. WHEN Vue components are defined THEN they SHALL have proper TypeScript definitions for all properties and methods
3. WHEN Element Plus components are used THEN they SHALL use correct type definitions for props
4. WHEN store properties are accessed THEN they SHALL be properly defined in the component setup
5. WHEN date formatting functions are used THEN they SHALL handle undefined values properly

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent type definitions across the project, so that the codebase is maintainable and type-safe.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN models are defined THEN they SHALL have consistent interface definitions
2. WHEN API responses are handled THEN they SHALL use proper type definitions
3. WHEN form data is processed THEN it SHALL be properly typed
4. WHEN validation is performed THEN it SHALL use typed validation schemas
5. WHEN utility functions are used THEN they SHALL have proper parameter and return types

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper error handling throughout the application, so that runtime errors are minimized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN async operations are performed THEN they SHALL have proper error handling
2. WHEN optional properties are accessed THEN they SHALL be checked for undefined values
3. WHEN type conversions are performed THEN they SHALL be done safely
4. WHEN external libraries are used THEN they SHALL be properly typed
5. WHEN database operations fail THEN they SHALL return appropriate error responses
