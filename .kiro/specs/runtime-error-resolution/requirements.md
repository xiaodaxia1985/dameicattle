# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for systematically resolving all runtime errors in the cattle management system to ensure the frontend, backend, and miniprogram components can run properly with full API connectivity and data contract consistency.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Backend API Stability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the backend API to start successfully and handle all requests without errors, so that the frontend applications can communicate with the server reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the backend server starts THEN it SHALL initialize without any module import errors
2. WHEN the backend receives API requests THEN it SHALL respond with consistent data formats
3. WHEN database connections are established THEN they SHALL be stable and properly configured
4. IF environment variables are missing THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback defaults
5. WHEN middleware is applied THEN it SHALL not cause route registration failures

### Requirement 2: Frontend-Backend API Integration

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want all API calls to successfully connect to backend endpoints, so that users can access all application features without connectivity errors.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN frontend makes API calls THEN backend SHALL have matching route endpoints
2. WHEN API responses are received THEN frontend SHALL parse data structures correctly
3. WHEN authentication is required THEN JWT tokens SHALL be properly validated
4. IF API calls fail THEN frontend SHALL display meaningful error messages
5. WHEN pagination is used THEN data structure SHALL be consistent across all endpoints

### Requirement 3: Data Contract Consistency

**User Story:** As a developer, I want consistent data structures between frontend and backend, so that there are no parsing errors or undefined property access issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN backend returns data THEN it SHALL follow the standardized response format
2. WHEN frontend processes responses THEN it SHALL handle both paginated and non-paginated data
3. WHEN optional properties are accessed THEN frontend SHALL use safe navigation operators
4. IF data structures change THEN both frontend and backend SHALL be updated consistently
5. WHEN arrays are expected THEN backend SHALL always return arrays, not undefined values

### Requirement 4: Environment Configuration

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want proper environment configuration for all components, so that the system can run in development, testing, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN environment files are loaded THEN all required variables SHALL be present
2. WHEN database connections are configured THEN they SHALL use environment-specific settings
3. WHEN CORS is configured THEN it SHALL allow proper frontend-backend communication
4. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL fail fast with clear error messages
5. WHEN services start THEN they SHALL use the correct ports and host configurations

### Requirement 5: Database Connectivity and Schema

**User Story:** As a backend developer, I want reliable database connections and proper schema initialization, so that all data operations work correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN database connections SHALL be established successfully
2. WHEN database queries are executed THEN they SHALL not fail due to schema issues
3. WHEN migrations are run THEN they SHALL complete without errors
4. IF database is unavailable THEN the system SHALL handle gracefully with retry logic
5. WHEN transactions are used THEN they SHALL maintain data consistency

### Requirement 6: File Upload and Static Asset Handling

**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload files and access static assets without errors, so that I can manage documents and images in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN files are uploaded THEN they SHALL be stored in the correct directory structure
2. WHEN static assets are requested THEN they SHALL be served with proper MIME types
3. WHEN file size limits are exceeded THEN appropriate error messages SHALL be returned
4. IF upload directories don't exist THEN they SHALL be created automatically
5. WHEN files are deleted THEN cleanup SHALL occur properly

### Requirement 7: Authentication and Authorization

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want proper authentication and authorization mechanisms, so that system access is secure and role-based.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users log in THEN JWT tokens SHALL be generated and validated correctly
2. WHEN protected routes are accessed THEN proper authorization checks SHALL occur
3. WHEN tokens expire THEN users SHALL be redirected to login appropriately
4. IF unauthorized access is attempted THEN proper error responses SHALL be returned
5. WHEN permissions are checked THEN they SHALL be enforced consistently

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a system maintainer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate detail levels
2. WHEN API errors happen THEN consistent error response formats SHALL be returned
3. WHEN system exceptions occur THEN they SHALL not crash the application
4. IF critical errors happen THEN appropriate alerts SHALL be generated
5. WHEN debugging is needed THEN logs SHALL provide sufficient context

### Requirement 9: Development Environment Setup

**User Story:** As a new developer, I want a simple setup process for the development environment, so that I can start contributing quickly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setup scripts are run THEN all dependencies SHALL be installed correctly
2. WHEN development servers start THEN they SHALL run on the correct ports
3. WHEN hot reload is enabled THEN changes SHALL be reflected immediately
4. IF setup fails THEN clear instructions SHALL be provided for resolution
5. WHEN multiple services run THEN they SHALL not conflict with each other

### Requirement 10: Miniprogram Integration

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want the WeChat miniprogram to connect properly to the backend API, so that I can access the cattle management system from my mobile device.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the miniprogram starts THEN it SHALL compile without build errors
2. WHEN miniprogram makes API calls THEN they SHALL successfully connect to the backend
3. WHEN user authentication occurs THEN it SHALL work consistently across web and miniprogram
4. IF network requests fail THEN appropriate error handling SHALL be implemented
5. WHEN data is displayed THEN it SHALL use the same data contracts as the web frontend

### Requirement 11: Multi-Component System Integration

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want all three components (backend, frontend, miniprogram) to run simultaneously without conflicts, so that the complete system is operational.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN all services start THEN they SHALL use non-conflicting ports and resources
2. WHEN the backend serves multiple clients THEN it SHALL handle concurrent requests properly
3. WHEN shared APIs are used THEN they SHALL work consistently for both web and miniprogram clients
4. IF one component fails THEN it SHALL not affect the operation of other components
5. WHEN system updates occur THEN all components SHALL maintain compatibility

### Requirement 12: Cross-Platform Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer using different operating systems, I want the system to work on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so that team members can use their preferred development environment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN scripts are executed THEN they SHALL work on Windows, macOS, and Linux
2. WHEN file paths are used THEN they SHALL be cross-platform compatible
3. WHEN shell commands are run THEN they SHALL use appropriate syntax for each OS
4. IF platform-specific issues occur THEN alternative solutions SHALL be provided
5. WHEN Docker is used THEN it SHALL provide consistent environments across platforms
